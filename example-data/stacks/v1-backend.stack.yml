# name:
#   This should match the service build/repo name
#
# abbrev_name:
#   Sometimes we have to give things names where AWS does not allow proper tags but instead has restricted fields of limited length (e.g. target groups).
#   These must only contain letters and numbers and hyphens, not start with a number, and be 17 characters or under (because the shortest restriction IRL so far is 32 characters + a "production-lb-" prefix).
