Templating support for OpenTofu / [Terraform](https://github.com/mehhhhhhhhhhhhhhh/terraform-templating)
=======

I have separate repos for the two tools, because it's not clear what direction either project is now going in, and they may end up diverging significantly.


An example
-------

The elusive dynamic backend/provider configuration -- at the time of writing, still [impossible](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/13022) in Terraform after many years; [maybe coming](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu/issues/300) in OpenTofu 1.9.

With the tool in this repo, it's just as trivial to do as any other variation:

```erb
provider "aws" {
  region  = "<%= Environment['region'] %>"
  version = "~> 4.23.0"
}

<%
opentofu_state_bucket_name =
  Environment['production_account'] ?
      "opentofu-state.#{Environment['region']}.#{Environment['production_account']}.example.com"
    : 'opentofu-state.dev.example.com'
%>

terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = "~> 4.23.0"
  }
  backend "s3" {
    bucket = "<%= opentofu_state_bucket_name %>"
    key    = "opentofu-<%= TofuVersion %>-aws-4.23-main.tfstate"
    region = "<%= Environment['production_account'] ? Environment['region'] : 'us-west-2' %>"
  }
}

```

This is an example of the ERB format (`.tf.erb`). ERB is a templating language like Jinja or PHP(!), except based on Ruby (and provided in Ruby's standard library).

For `resource` and `data` declarations, we also have the option of a simple **Ruby DSL** (domain-specific language).

In the example above, the template contains references to **external configuration** for the `Environment` (workspace) being worked on.

* More of this type of code, including the Ruby DSL (`.tf.rb`), can be seen in [`examples/with-env-data`](examples/with-env-data).
* The sample config files it's using can be seen in [`example-data`](example-data).
* In this directory, the `./plan` script is a symlink to [`lib/terraform-templating/plan-with-env-data`](lib/terraform-templating/plan-with-env-data).

This is not strictly necessary -- the templating tool can also be used by itself, **without the need for any external files** at all.

* This type of code, directly referencing a local JSON file for code generation, can be seen in [`examples/standalone`](examples/standalone).
* In this example directory, the `./plan` script is a symlink to [`lib/terraform-templating/plan-standalone`](lib/terraform-templating/plan-standalone).


How to get started
-------

Clone [`lib/terraform-templating`](lib/terraform-templating) somewhere.

Create a symlink (in this example, called `plan`) to the [`plan-standalone`](lib/terraform-templating/plan-standalone) script in that directory, from your OpenTofu project directory.

Use this `./plan` link instead of directly calling `tofu`, and a `work/` subdirectory will be created with the evaluated template results, and links to all your other original files. Then, `tofu` will be called in that directory instead of your original directory.

To **test template evaluation without calling OpenTofu**, just call `./plan -t` and the `work/` directory will be created without calling any command.

Just `./plan` by default will run `tofu plan -out result.plan | tee result.planning`. Both of these files will end up in the `work/` directory.

Then, `./plan -- apply result.plan` will pick up that `result.plan` file, since it also calls OpenTofu from that same `work/` directory.

The `result.planning` file is sometimes useful if you want to review the results of the plan later, or compare them with other results.

You can run any other OpenTofu command within the `work/` directory in the same way, by passing it to `./plan` instead of `apply`:

* `./plan -- workspace new potato`
* `./plan -- import aws_instance.thing i-0123456789`


Other variations
-------

This isn't a framework -- it's just an example, which can be easily modified for different needs. You should own your own interface!

Check out the repo, and compare the changes from `plan-standalone` to `plan-with-env-data` in [`lib/terraform-templating`](lib/terraform-templating) -- you'll see that the customization needed is pretty minimal, to get similar results with your own project layout.


Hidden depths
-------

* The `with-env-data` example, since it uses a different directory for each generated environment, also allows multiple environments' plans to be run concurrently without any trouble.

* Each working directory gets symlinked to a single copy of the OpenTofu plugins / providers, which ends up in the `lib` directory next to the source script.
